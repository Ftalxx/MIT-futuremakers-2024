# NumPy

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to NumPy
* Arrays/Matrices
* Matrix operations

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
Today, I was able to work with NumPy, a key Python library for handling numbers and arrays. I explored creating and manipulating arrays, using functions like concatenate to merge arrays and repeat to duplicate data. I also got into basic matrix operations and was introduced to cool stuff like image enhancement and few shot learning.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I found Question 3 and 5 particularly challenging. Question 3 required me to swap dimensions of a 3D array using NumPy's transpose function, which took some thinking to get right. Similarly, Question 5 tasked me with calculating the rank of a matrix using np.linalg.matrix_rank(), which was a bit tricky to grasp initially. Despite the challenges, working through these problems helped me understand the content more.
