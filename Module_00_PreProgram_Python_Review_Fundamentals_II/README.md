# Python Fundamentals II

## Topics covered in today's module

* Object Oriented Programming
* Debugging in Python
* Package Handling

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

Today's assignment taught me essential concepts in Python programming, emphasizing functions as tools to simplify complex tasks into manageable pieces. I learned about classes and inheritance, which are foundational in creating structured, reusable code through object-oriented programming. Error handling became clearer with try-except blocks, enabling me to manage potential issues gracefully. Debugging techniques like using print statements and assertions helped me identify and resolve errors effectively. Additionally, I explored practical applications of Python in deep learning, such as neural networks and image synthesis, highlighting its versatility in modern technologies. Overall, the assignment provided valuable insights into Python's capabilities in computer science and AI, enhancing my skills in both coding and problem-solving.


## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

Today's assignment had its challenging and rewarding moments, especially when working on defining classes and tackling question two. Understanding how to structure classes in Python was initially tough, but as I delved deeper, I found it gratifying to see how classes can organize code effectively and make it reusable. Question two required creating a subclass of the list class, called NumberList, where I had to ensure that only numeric values could be added or inserted. This task not only improved my understanding of inheritance but also sharpened my skills in managing data structures with specific requirements. Overall, grappling with these concepts was both demanding and engaging, significantly enhancing my Python programming and design skills.

## Additional resources
1. Did you need to use tools like AI tools ChatGPT or Gemini to answer any of the questions or learn any of the concepts in this notebook? If  yes, state for which questions or concepts did you require Generative AI tools? 

Yes I did, only for syntax and slight debug in question 2.

2. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, which part of the answers are written by you, and which part of the answers are written by an AI tool?

None of it is written by AI, I simply asked how I would approach a similar problem and used the syntax given.

4. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, after using the AI tool to gain a better understanding of the material in this notebook, summarize your learnings here.

It did help, especially with the notes on the topic.
