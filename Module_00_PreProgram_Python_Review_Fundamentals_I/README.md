## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

  Today's assignment served as a quick refresher for me, covering fundamental Python concepts that I'm already familiar with. It was more of a warm-up exercise rather than something entirely new. I revisited handling user   input using input() and manipulating strings with methods like split() and slicing. The exercises also included working with lists for data storage and manipulation, understanding dictionaries for key-value pairs, and     exploring sets for unique data handling. Additionally, I reviewed flow control with if, elif, and else statements, practiced loops (for and while) for iterative tasks, and revisited basic arithmetic operations. Overall,   it was a beneficial session to brush up on these core concepts.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

  Today's assignment introduced me to some really cool concepts, especially diving into neural image style transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It's fascinating how you can take the content of one image      and blend it with the style of another to create something entirely new and artistic. I got to see examples where the Cubist style was applied to the Mona Lisa, resulting in a unique blend that showcases the power of      deep learning in visual arts.

  Even more exciting is knowing that this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what CNNs can do. The prospect of building and using these networks to create such artistic outputs really sparked my interest so I went   deepdiving and watched a couple of videos regarding the topic myself.

  Another intriguing aspect was learning about neural language style transfer. It's like magic how you can take a piece of text and transform its style without altering its meaning. Whether it's converting casual writing   to a formal tone or vice versa, the ability to manipulate language styles opens up a lot of creative possibilities.

## Additional resources
1. Did you need to use tools like AI tools ChatGPT or Gemini to answer any of the questions or learn any of the concepts in this notebook? If  yes, state for which questions or concepts did you require Generative AI tools? 

  Yes, I used ChatGPT for question 5. 

2. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, which part of the answers are written by you, and which part of the answers are written by an AI tool?

  The only line of code written by the AI was return list(string) == list(reversed(string)).

4. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, after using the AI tool to gain a better understanding of the material in this notebook, summarize your learnings here.

  Yes it did, it was a simple syntax mistake but after trying for over 30 minutes I was very frustrated in which I just aimed to get assistance not the answer to the entire problem.
