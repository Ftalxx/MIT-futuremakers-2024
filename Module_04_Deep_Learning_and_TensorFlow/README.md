* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I explored the concepts behind Linear Regression:

- What does .score() indicate?
.score() computes the coefficient of determination (ùëÖ^2), showing how well the model predicts the target based on input data.

- What do reg.coef_ and reg.intercept_ represent?
reg.coef_ are the coefficients assigned to features, indicating their impact on the target.
reg.intercept_ is the bias term, representing the expected mean value of the target when all features are zero.

## Visualization
I visualized how the Linear Regression model attempts to separate the four classes in the XOR dataset using a line. This visualization highlighted the model's limitations in handling non-linear separations.

## Neural Network Modeling with TensorFlow
To explore more complex patterns in the XOR dataset, I used TensorFlow to build neural networks. Here's what I learned:

- Question 2
I compared a deeper neural network model to a simpler one:

Effect of adding layers and nodes on model performance?
Adding more layers and nodes generally improves the model's ability to learn complex patterns, potentially reducing loss and improving accuracy.

- Question 3
I experimented with adding layers incrementally to find optimal model performance:

Maximum number of layers for improved accuracy?
Increasing layers allows the network to capture deeper feature hierarchies, enhancing its ability to classify the XOR dataset accurately.

- Question 4
I discussed activation functions in the final layer of neural networks:

Why use sigmoid instead of softmax?
Sigmoid is suitable for binary classification tasks like ours, providing output probabilities between 0 and 1, ideal for distinguishing between two classes.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Overcoming obstacles such as overfitting and underfitting models provided valuable learning experiences. Troubleshooting errors and optimizing model performance taught me more than I had expected so now I can understand the concept better.
