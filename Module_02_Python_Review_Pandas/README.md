* Operations on Tabular data

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

Pandas Fundamentals: Through practical examples and exercises, I solidified my understanding of fundamental Pandas concepts such as Series and DataFrames. These structures are essential for handling and manipulating data efficiently in Python.

Data Manipulation: I gained hands-on experience with various data manipulation techniques such as filtering rows based on conditions, accessing specific elements using loc and iloc, and performing sorting operations on DataFrame columns.

Data Analysis Skills: By working through exercises like finding unique classes in a dataset, filtering data based on specific criteria (example. calories < 400 and taste == 'Sweet'), and extracting descriptive statistics.

This repository contains various exercises and examples showcasing Pandas' capabilities:

Dataframe Metadata: Demonstrates how to retrieve information about DataFrame structure and content.
Accessing Elements: Shows different methods to access and manipulate DataFrame elements.
Sorting and Ranking: Illustrates sorting operations on DataFrame columns.
Example Questions: Includes practical exercises like finding unique classes, filtering data based on conditions, and more.

It's amazing how Pandas simplifies complex data tasks, from basic data cleaning to advanced statistical analysis. The ability to manipulate data effortlessly using Pandas opens up endless possibilities for data-driven insights.


## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

One of the challenging aspects was figuring out how to filter the DataFrame based on multiple conditions effectively. For example, filtering dishes that are both 'Sweet' and have calories less than 400 required careful use of boolean indexing in Pandas.
